name: English Writing Rules
description: Rules for writing consistent English in code and documentation.

1. Style Matching
   - Follow the project's existing dialect (e.g., `color` vs. `colour`).
   - Default to British English if no style is established.
2. Terminology
   - Reuse exact identifiers from the codebase (e.g., documentation for `api_key` must never use `apiKey` or `API key`).
